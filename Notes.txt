class 1 live -

create maven project
give name to group id and artifact id

cucumber starts from -
firstly, we write test case/scenario
secondly, generate step definitions

    rules to remember -
        every step definition should be unique.
        after generating step def, we cannot add anything in feature file.
        we can reuse all the steps in feature file, but we cannot add step def in every class.

 Background -
 till the time flow is same in all the common steps for the scenarios in one feature file.

 Hooks -
 rule -  it has just 2 tags  - @before @after
 it will be available always under steps package

Flow of execution - > hooks will be executed then background will be executed and then scenario will be executed.

Data driven testing -> when one test case executes against multiple sets of data hooks, background and scenario will be
executed based on total sets of data. we implement scenario outline with examples table

Framework -> structure:
main - for developers
test - QA automation engineers - to write the code thorough which we test
  - java - to write all java classes
  - resources - to write all non-java stuff such as feature files, excel, config files etc.
to keep all the feature files at on place

utility package - > common methods class - all the methods and webdriver to be used config reader class to read all the
the properties from config.prop file
